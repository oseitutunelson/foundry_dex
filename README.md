## Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Smart Contract

# Overview

   This Solidity smart contract implements a basic decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain. The DEX allows users to deposit and withdraw ERC-20 tokens and ether, place limit orders, fill orders, and add liquidity to the exchange.

# Features
   
   - Token Operations:

    Deposit and withdraw ERC-20 tokens.
    Deposit and withdraw ether.

- Order Book:

    Place limit orders specifying the token, total tokens, and desired ether amount.
    Fill existing orders based on availability and user balance.

- Liquidity Pool:

    Add liquidity by providing ERC-20 tokens and ether to the liquidity pool

# Smart Contract Architecture

    The smart contract is structured as follows:

- DEX Contract:
        Manages the overall functionality of the decentralized exchange.
        Allows the owner to add supported tokens.
        Handles token and ether deposits, withdrawals, and order placements.

    - Order Structure:
        Represents the details of an order, including the trader's address, token, total tokens, remaining tokens, ether amount, and filled amount.

  -  Liquidity Structure:
        Represents the details of liquidity provided, including the provider's address, token, token amount, and ether amount.     

# Getting Started
- Deployment

    Deploy the DEX smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
    Set the contract owner address during deployment.

- Usage

   - Adding Tokens:
        Call the addToken function as the owner to add supported tokens to the DEX.

   - Depositing and Withdrawing:
        Deposit ERC-20 tokens using the depositToken function.
        Deposit ether using the deposit function.
        Withdraw ERC-20 tokens using the withdrawTokens function.
        Withdraw ether using the withdraw function.

   - Placing Orders:
        Place limit orders using the placeOrder function, specifying the token, total tokens, and desired ether amount.

   - Filling Orders:
        Fill existing orders using the fillOrder function by providing the order ID.

   - Adding Liquidity:
        Add liquidity using the addLiquidity function, providing ERC-20 tokens and ether.

# Security Considerations

    Use the SafeERC20 library to ensure safe ERC-20 token operations.
    Ensure thorough testing and auditing before deploying the contract to the Ethereum mainnet.
    Consider additional security measures based on specific use cases.
